# CS 260 Notes





[Below are example notes for later:

## AWS

My server IP address is: 100.49.237.214
I might have to change this in future; my school email account was having problems so I ended up making a new account with my personal. Hopefully I can merge them somehow. Also I want to see if the price is still the same for Elastic vs running t3.nano. Command to ssh into server is ssh -i [key file] ubuntu@[IP]

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.
