# CS 260 Notes





[Below are example notes for later:

## AWS

My server IP address is: 100.49.237.214
I might have to change this in future; my school email account was having problems so I ended up making a new account with my personal. Hopefully I can merge them somehow. Also I want to see if the price is still the same for Elastic vs running t3.nano. Command to ssh into server is ssh -i [key file] ubuntu@[IP]
Domain name is miradoc260.click

## Caddy

Worked smoothly; I'd like to study Caddy a little bit more though.

## HTML

Something I'm getting from Codepen practice (https://codepen.io/JWHitch/pen/YPWYqEJ, forked from https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/GRGBqbw) is you really need to have the right element for the attributes you're using; you can't just add an img or href to anything.
