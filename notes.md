# CS 260 Notes

## AWS

My server IP address is: 100.49.237.214
I might have to change this in future; my school email account was having problems so I ended up making a new account with my personal. Hopefully I can merge them somehow. Also I want to see if the price is still the same for Elastic vs running t3.nano. Command to ssh into server is ssh -i [key file] ubuntu@[IP]
Domain name is miradoc260.click

## Caddy

Worked smoothly; I'd like to study Caddy a little bit more though.

## HTML

Something I'm getting from Codepen practice (https://codepen.io/JWHitch/pen/YPWYqEJ, forked from https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/GRGBqbw) is you really need to have the right element for the attributes you're using; you can't just add an img or href to anything. Something I've learned is the difference between "block" and "inline" elements, and how that distinction is important. I've discovered that writing basic HTML is often not that hard; getting the first page is more difficult, but from there a lot of copy/paste can help make the other pages significantly easier. I hope we study more in future how to use elements across webpages. Copy/paste can be fine, but it has the same problem as in a lot of other programming languages: changing it is much more of a hassle, and one has to be careful to keep everything up to date!
